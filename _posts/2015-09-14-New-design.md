Once in a while you get sick of your old code that you've written and you just
feel that you have to rip it out and replace it with new better code.

Well, that's exactly what happened here. The CSS for this site was a mess,
even though it was very simple and only contained a handfull of styles
making it adaptable to smaller screens was hard. So what I've done now is
replaced it all with new and shiny css.

The idea on how to layout your css was taken from HTML5 Boilerplate.
It's a very good project where you can find a lot of info on how to setup
and structure your project and also things to think about in order to support
different screen sizes and it makes use of some new stuff from the HTML5 spec.
